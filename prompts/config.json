Consider:\n\n- Color temperature (warm = 2000-2700K, neutral = 3000-4000K, cool = 5000-6500K)\n- Brightness percentage (0-100%)\n- The emotional quality they're trying to create\n\nExamples of interpretations:\n- \"fire/campfire/warm glow\" \u2192 very warm (2000-2500K), medium brightness (40-60%)\n- \"ocean/water/beach\" \u2192 cool blue tones (5000-6500K), medium-bright (50-70%)\n- \"cozy/relaxing/intimate\" \u2192 warm (2200-2700K), dimmer (30-50%)\n- \"energizing/focus/productive\" \u2192 cool white (4000-5000K), bright (80-100%)\n- \"romantic\" \u2192 very warm (2000-2200K), very dim (10-30%)\n- \"reading\" \u2192 neutral-warm (3000-3500K), bright (70-90%)\n\nUse your judgment. Prioritize comfort and the user's aesthetic preferences.\nWhen unsure, you can ask clarifying questions.",

    "system": "# Philips Hue Capabilities via Home Assistant\n\n## Available Service Calls\n\n### light.turn_on\nParameters:\n- brightness_pct (0-100): Brightness percentage\n- color_temp (mireds): Color temperature in mireds (153-500 for most Hue)\n- color_temp_kelvin: Color temperature in Kelvin (2000-6535)\n- transition: Transition time in seconds\n- flash: 'short' or 'long' - makes light flash\n- effect: Special effects like 'colorloop'\n- xy_color: Precise color control [x, y] coordinates\n\n### hue.activate_scene\nParameters:\n- entity_id: Hue scene entity ID\n- transition: Transition duration in seconds\n- dynamic: Enable/disable dynamic (animated) mode\n- speed: Speed of dynamic palette\n- brightness: Scene brightness override\n\n## Important Constraints\n\n1. Rate Limits: Don't send commands faster than every 100ms\n2. Transitions: Minimum practical transition is 0.1s\n3. Groups: Can control rooms (groups of lights) or individual lights\n4. Effects: Built-in effects depend on light model\n\n## Creating Flicker/Dynamic Effects\n\n**Approach: Built-in Scenes**\n- Use existing dynamic scenes with dynamic=true\n- Hue handles the animation internally\n- Less API control but smoother\n\n**Anti patterns: Rapid Updates**\n- Use Built-in or custom scenes; don't send sequential commands directly to lights to create an effect (in other words, DON'T send sequential turn_on commands with varying brightness/color & use short transitions (0.3-1.5s) for smooth changes)",
