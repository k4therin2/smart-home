# Roadmap

## How to Read This Roadmap

### Terminology
- **Phase**: Major milestone grouping (e.g., "Phase 2: Device Integrations + Security")
- **Work Package**: Individual unit of work that can be assigned to one agent (atomic, single-PR scope)
- **Parallel Group**: Work packages with no dependencies that can run simultaneously

### Understanding Dependencies
- **Can start immediately**: Status is ⚪ Not Started with no "Blocked by" line
- **Must wait**: Has "Blocked by" line listing required work packages
- **Parallel-safe**: Work packages in the same Parallel Group can run at the same time

### Claiming Work
1. Check `#coordination` channel for active work to avoid conflicts
2. Choose a ⚪ Not Started work package with no blockers
3. Post to `#coordination`: "Claiming [Work Package ID]: [Title]"
4. Begin work immediately

### Status Icons
- ⚪ Not Started (available to claim if no blockers)
- 🟡 In Progress (actively being worked)
- 🟢 Complete (moved to archive)
- 🔴 Blocked (waiting on dependencies)

---

## Recent Completions

**2025-12-29:** Intensive roadmap gardening by Agent-Henry. Moved 30 completed work packages to archive (`plans/archive/`). Added 27 new work packages from backlog, requirements gaps, and deferrals. Roadmap now shows only active/future work.

**Archive Location:** All completed work packages now in `plans/archive/phase*/`

---

## Alerting Standards

All work packages must include appropriate Slack alerts for operational visibility. Use these channels:

**#colby-server-security** - Server-level security events:
- SSH authentication failures
- UFW firewall blocks
- Intrusion detection alerts
- File integrity violations
- Suspicious process activity

**#smarthome-costs** - Cost management alerts:
- Daily API cost threshold exceeded ($5/day)
- Monthly budget warnings
- Unusual API usage spikes

**#smarthome-health** - Service health monitoring:
- Service up/down status changes
- Home Assistant connectivity issues
- Device connectivity failures
- Self-healing actions (success/failure)
- Critical service restarts

**Acceptance Criteria for All Work:**
- [ ] Appropriate alerts configured for the feature area
- [ ] Alert messages include actionable context
- [ ] Alert severity appropriate to the channel

  - [x] Purchase Philips Hue bulbs/light strips
  - [x] Physically install lights in rooms
  - [x] Set up Hue bridge on local network
  - [x] Add Philips Hue integration to Home Assistant

## BUGS & ISSUES

#### BUG-001: Voice Puck Green Blink But No Response
- **Status:** 🔴 Blocked (needs user to check HA logs)
- **Priority:** P0 (core voice feature broken)
- **Reported:** 2025-12-20
- **Reporter:** Katherine (user)
- **Investigated:** 2025-12-20 by Agent-Anette, Agent-Nadia
- **Owner:** User (needs HA log inspection)
- **Symptom:** Voice puck blinks green after "hey jarvis what time is it" but doesn't produce any audio response
- **Investigation Findings (Agent-Nadia, 2025-12-20 14:16):**
  - ✅ Voice puck (192.168.1.30) is online and pingable
  - ✅ SmartHome server running correctly on ports 5049/5050
  - ✅ HA running in Docker with --network=host (localhost works correctly)
  - ✅ Direct API calls work: curl to /api/voice_command returns correct responses
  - ✅ Assist pipeline correctly configured:
    - STT: stt.faster_whisper
    - TTS: tts.piper (en_US-lessac-medium)
    - Conversation: smart_home_agent custom component
  - ❌ SmartHome logs show NO voice puck commands today - only test suite and curl tests
  - ❓ Issue is between wake word detection and SmartHome server
- **Diagnosis:**
  The SmartHome server and HA configuration are correct. The issue is in the HA voice pipeline:
  1. **Faster Whisper STT** may not be transcribing correctly
  2. **Assist pipeline** may not be routing to smart_home_agent
  3. **Voice puck** may not be sending audio to HA correctly
- **Required User Actions:**
  - [ ] When speaking to puck, check HA logs in real-time: Settings > System > Logs (set to DEBUG)
  - [ ] Test assist pipeline directly: Developer Tools > Services > assist_pipeline.run
  - [ ] Check voice puck ESPHome logs for audio/connection errors
  - [ ] Verify faster_whisper is transcribing: check HA logs for "stt" entries
- **Related:** WP-3.1a (Voice Software - Complete), WP-3.1b (Voice Hardware - Complete), WP-9.2 (Voice Diagnostics - Complete)

- **Status:** ⚪ Not Started
- **Priority:** P3 (research phase)
- **Effort:** XL (needs breakdown after research)
- **Owner:** Unassigned
- **Source:** Backlog (added 2025-12-29)
- **Description:** LoRa mesh network for smart home automation
- **Research Phase Tasks:**

- **Use Cases:**
  1. **Dog tracking (Sophie)** - GPS collar tracker, no subscription fees
  2. **User presence detection** - Keychain tracker for automations
  3. **Chicken coop automation** - Door, temp, lights, predator detection
  4. **Garden sensors** - Soil moisture, temp, irrigation
- **Technical Notes:**
  - LoRa long-range, low-power mesh
  - No subscription fees (vs cellular trackers)
  - Native HA integration via MQTT
  - Solar-powered outdoor nodes possible
  - Range testing needed across property
  - Weatherproofing for outdoor nodes
  - Privacy/security of mesh network
- **Decision Point:** After research, break into smaller work packages or defer

## DEFERRED INDEFINITELY (High Risk / Low ROI)

These items are explicitly deferred and will not be added to active roadmap unless strong community demand emerges:

### REQ-030: Automated Order Management
- **Status:** ❌ Deferred Indefinitely
- **Reason:** High legal/financial risk, unclear user value
- **Reconsider:** Only if community demand emerges Month 12+

### REQ-035: Secure E-Commerce Integration
- **Status:** ❌ Deferred Indefinitely
- **Reason:** Dependency for REQ-030 (also deferred)
- **Reconsider:** Only with REQ-030

### Native Mobile App (React Native)
- **Status:** ❌ Deferred Indefinitely
- **Reason:** PWA works well, native app is low ROI
- **Reconsider:** Only if community strongly demands it

### Zigbee/Z-Wave Direct Support
- **Status:** ❌ Deferred Indefinitely
- **Reason:** Home Assistant handles this well already
- **Reconsider:** Unlikely - HA integration is the better path

## Architecture Decisions

### LLM Provider: OpenAI (Not Anthropic)

**Decision Date:** 2025-12-20

The Smart Home system uses **OpenAI API** (gpt-4o-mini) for all LLM calls, NOT Anthropic.

**Key Points:**
- All LLM calls go through the unified abstraction layer in `src/llm_client.py`
- Current default: OpenAI API with `gpt-4o-mini` model
- The abstraction layer supports OpenAI, Anthropic, and local LLMs (Ollama, LM Studio)
- Future plan: Replace with local LLM for cost reduction and privacy (WP-10.8)
- Another agent is working on improving the LLM abstraction layer

**Configuration:**
- Environment variables: `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_MODEL` (not `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- To switch providers: Set `LLM_PROVIDER` env var to "openai", "anthropic", or "local"
- Provider-specific config in `src/config.py` imports OpenAI settings by default

**Migration Notes:**
- Any legacy Anthropic API calls in the codebase should be migrated to use `src/llm_client.py`
- The main agent loop in `agent.py` may still reference Anthropic patterns in comments - these are historical
- All new features must use the LLMClient abstraction, not direct API calls

**Why This Matters:**
- Prevents agents from accidentally using the wrong API
- Centralizes all LLM calls for easier provider switching
- Prepares for future local LLM migration (cost reduction from $730/year to $36/year)
