## This is a list of Katherine's ideas that can maybe implemented at some point 
### (but shouldn't be pursued now because nothing will get done)

- set up a UI for home assist that lets me see how my api useage is going/track overall throughput on network to check nothing odd happening
- agent to keep an eye on system perf/design architecture off above ^
- agent for music picking albums
- TRACK API USEAGE IN UI
- caching/autoproccess regular asks
