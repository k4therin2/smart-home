Run the test suite. By default runs all tests with coverage. Options:

- No arguments: Run all tests with coverage report
- Specific file/module: Run only those tests (e.g., "test_config" or "tests/test_lights.py")
- "coverage": Run with detailed coverage report
- "fast": Run without coverage for quick validation

Activate the virtual environment first, then run pytest with appropriate flags.
